                Aiden is a rising sophomore at Rowan University majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. His entrepreneurial passion stems from his parents who came to America to build a new life for themselves. With a passion for design and service, he wanted to create a product that would not only help others but revolutionize an industry as well. To him, Circlez resembles the support system that he, Sydney, and their friends had in grade school, and he wants to share it with others. In his free time, Aiden enjoys reading, playing basketball, tennis, pickleball, and spending time with loved ones.
